## The k-means clustering method is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to identify clusters of data objects in a dataset.


#### The k-means algorithm searches for a pre-determined number of clusters within an unlabeled multidimensional dataset. It accomplishes this using a simple conception of what the optimal clustering looks like:

> The "cluster center" is the arithmetic mean of all the points belonging to the cluster.
> Each point is closer to its own cluster center than to other cluster centers.
